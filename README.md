# Python Learning Laboratory (python-tests)

A collection of high-quality Python guides, scripts, and tests designed for mastering core language concepts, from basic collections to advanced metaprogramming.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 🎓 Educational Guides
Comprehensive, well-commented scripts that explain key Python features:

- **[collections_guide.py](collections_guide.py)**: Deep dive into Lists, Sets, Dictionaries, and Tuples, including advanced techniques like NamedTuples and DefaultDicts.
- **[reflection_introspection_guide.py](reflection_introspection_guide.py)**: Mastery of `id()`, `type()`, `getattr()`, and runtime object investigation.
- **[comprehensions.py](comprehensions.py)** / **[list_comprehensions.py](list_comprehensions.py)**: Efficiently generating sequences using list, dict, and set comprehensions.
- **[string_methods.py](string_methods.py)**: Exploration of built-in string manipulation power.
- **[sequence_operators.py](sequence_operators.py)**: Understanding slices, indexing, and iteration protocols.

### 🧠 Advanced Concepts
Exploring the boundaries of the Python language:

- **[metaprogramming.py](metaprogramming.py)**: Introduction to decorators, metaclasses, and dynamic class creation.
- **[lamda_functions.py](lamda_functions.py)**: Use cases for anonymous functions and functional programming patterns.
- **[hash_tester.py](hash_tester.py)**: Investigating object hashability and dictionary key requirements.

### 🧪 Misc & OOP
- **[my_dog.py](my_dog.py)**: Basics of Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Instances).
- **[main_file.py](main_file.py)**: General testing ground for ephemeral ideas.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Simply clone the repo and run any script using Python 3:

```bash
python3 <filename>.py
```

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.9+ (due to modern features like the merge operator `|` for dicts)
